#Problem Set 7: Particle Filter Tracking

##Description
In this problem set you are going to experiment with a particle filter tracker such as was described in class.

## Setup
Clone this repository recursively:
`git clone --recursive https://github.gatech.edu/omscs6476/ps07.git`

(If your version of git does not support recurse clone, then clone without the option and tun `git submodule init` and `git submodule update`).

##Instructions
If you have questions, please post them to Piazza.
[Problem Set 7: Particle Filter Tracking](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11ZTbKVE88qmZHD1v7pe4Uuh3Nk_3-lVjyJL83GRvo7o/edit?usp=sharing)

Once you are ready to submit run the following command:
`python submit.py --provider gt`

This will automatically send your `ps7.py` file to the auto grader. Notice that **only one file** is sent so do not split your code in multiple files.
