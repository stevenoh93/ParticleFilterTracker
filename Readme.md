#Problem Set 7: Particle Filter Tracking

##Description
In this problem set you are going to experiment with a particle filter tracker such as was described in class.

##Setup
If you have not already done so, please follow the instructions in the file [Installation.md](https://github.gatech.edu/omscs6476/ps01/blob/master/Installation.md) to setup your development environment.

First, clone this repository:
        `git clone --recursive https://github.gatech.edu/omscs6476/ps07.git`


In addition to script files provided in this repository, you will need to import some dependencies from another git repository.  Running

<pre>
	<code>
		git submodule init
		git submodule update
	</code>
</pre>

should do the trick.

##Instructions
If you have questions, please post them to Piazza.

The problem set requirements are in this link: 
[Problem Set 7: Particle Filter Tracking](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11ZTbKVE88qmZHD1v7pe4Uuh3Nk_3-lVjyJL83GRvo7o/edit?usp=sharing)

Once you are ready to submit run the following command:
`python submit.py --provider gt`

This will automatically send your `ps7.py` file to the auto grader. Notice that **only one file** is sent so do not split your code in multiple files.
